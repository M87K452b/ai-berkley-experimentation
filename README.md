# What I learned
**1. Concepts and Implementation of search algorithms such as breadth first search,
deapth first search and uniform cost graph search functions in a 2D - grid world.**

**2. Getting, cleaning and setting up a simple neural network using tensorflow to
make a univariate timeseries prediction. Setting up convolutional neural networks for LSTM**

**3. Categorical image classification of images using MNIST hand written digit dataset,
tensorflow and keras. Setting up convolutional neural networks in tensorflow and general image
classification.**
